After this, it goes to annual licensing with different uses. Get in quick to be grandfathered in for lifetime updates.<br \\/>\\n<strong>Woo Layout Injector<\\/strong> is by far the most powerful plugin designed for Divi\\/Extra to give a huge amount of control over your WooCommerce site. It allows you to edit the layout and styling of the WooCommerce single product pages, the shop page, the product category pages, the cart page, the checkout page AND the my account pages. Some of these can be done either centrally or on a per product basis.<\\/p>\\n<p>The\\u00a0ideal Divi Commerce solution, Woo Layout Injector\\u00a0works on Divi\\u00a0and Extra, neither of which\\u00a0allow <span style=\\\"text-decoration: underline;\\\">any<\\/span> configuration at all unless you are able to code in PHP and CSS. Even a seasoned developer will spend a while getting their WooCommerce layouts just right and to look 'non-stock'. This plugin facilitates that.<\\/p>\\n<p>In literally minutes you can create both a shop layout and product page layout and assign them to your site. You can set the layouts centrally via the settings page meaning if you want to change your store at any time then you need only edit one layout. You can also override\\u00a0the layouts by product category or even on a per product basis making this plugin ideal for any type of store. If you want to really fine tune your experience you can tailor make your cart page, checkout page and my account pages. All using the Divi Builder!<\\/p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/divilife.com\\/product\\/divi-overlays\\/ref\\/6\\/?campaign=WLI\\\">See what Tim Strifler over at Divi LIfe has done with this phenomenal Plugin<\\/a><\\/p>\\n<p>The uber talented <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/elegantmarketplace.com\\/vendor\\/melissa-love\\/\\\">Melissa Love<\\/a>\\u00a0of The Design Space uses it on one of her beautiful client sites and in some of her ecommerce related child themes - <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.cococuscino.com\\/product\\/coco-hurricane\\/\\\">take a look\\u00a0<\\/a><\\/p>\\n<p>A <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/elegantmarketplace.com\\/vendor\\/michellen\\/\\\">Michelle Nunan of Divi Soup<\\/a> uses the Woo Layout injector in her ecommerce child themes too - it really is a fantastically appreciated Divi Plugin<\\/p>\\n<p>To really put the icing on the cake you have a beautiful header mini cart and a whole raft of custom made modules to allow you to design your pages as you see fit!<\\/p>\\n<p>In short, this plugin adds a number of bespoke and highly configurable custom modules to the Divi Builder and a settings page to link them together. You have the freedom of the Divi Page Builder which we all know and love to construct a variety of layouts to suit your needs!<\\/p>\\n<p>Using Woo Layout Injector you can create a <span style=\\\"text-decoration: underline;\\\">very flexible<\\/span> and configurable layout for your WooCommerce archives and product category pages. To make this as flexible as possible we create TWO layouts. One\\u00a0that will be used for the archive page itself and another\\u00a0which is repeatedly used for each <em>item (product)<\\/em>\\u00a0in 'the loop'.<\\/p>\\n<p>Let's say we have an archive page showing 9 items in 3 rows of 3 items. We first create a 'loop item' template in the Divi library (Divi Library &gt; Add new &gt; Layout (non global)). This will feature normally an image, title, price, read more button etc..\\u00a0Once that is saved you can create the second layout which will be the archive. This\\u00a0may feature a nice header, the 'loop archive' module\\u00a0and then a footer or anything else to suit your design! Within the loop archive module you can select list or grid view. I find that list view works well especially when your 'loop item' layout has multiple columns of it's own or a grid of products such as that used on elegantmarketplace.com.<\\/p>\\n<p>For a Deeper Dive and full instructions on how to use this plugin once installed - <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/elegantmarketplace.com\\/the-ultimate-manual-on-the-woo-layout-injector\\/\\\">have a look at this great article where you can download a full instructional PDF.\\u00a0<\\/a><br \\/>\\nThat's it!<br \\/>\\nEach time you want to make a change to the layout just visit the Divi Library page and edit your layout as before. No need to relink or anything else. This really is a set and forget plugin that will yield a unique and bespoke looking WooCommerce store without you having to write any code at all :)<br \\/>\\nModules<br \\/>\\nThere are no fewer than custom 37 modules available to you using Woo Injector.

This plugin was released and flourished from mid 2016. It was, and still is, revolutionary in the features and functionality on offer with new updates coming all the time. Keep an eye on the changelog on this page or within the plugin itself for more exciting additions to the plugin. The new layout library will be a site showing a number of product page and product archive layouts created using Woo Layout Injector with the option to download the JSON files for use on your own store. Watch this space!<br \\/>\\nVideo<br \\/>\\nThis video is an hour long but it shows me setting up and explaining how the plugin works and how to integrate it into your site in a clear way. (was made for 4.0, we are now a few months down the line and some of the screens may have changed).<\\/p>\\n<p>https:\\/\\/youtu.be\\/zviia2GsCSc<br \\/>\\nNote<br \\/>\\nAdding the new modules to a non WooCommerce page are unlikely to work. The modules are designed for use on a WooCommerce product page only via the Divi library. Please contact us if you are unsure about this or have a problem setting things up.<\\/p>\\n<p>This plugin is designed to\\u00a0work with the vast majority of third party WooCommerce extensions. On occasion, third party plugins which also modify the product page may not be 100% compatible. <strong>Don't worry though!<\\/strong> Simply put in a support request with the vendor or Elegant Marketplace and we shall build in compatibility as soon as we are able.<\\/p>\\n<p><em>Please be aware though that we comprehensively test Woo Layout Injector with a variety of popular WooCommerce plugins to ensure compatibility across the range.<\\/em><\\/p>\\n<p>We have an Excellent guide to setup and troubleshooting on the Elegant Marketplace blog.

If you want to really fine tune your experience you can tailor make your cart page, checkout page and my account pages. All using the Divi Builder!<\\/p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/divilife.com\\/product\\/divi-overlays\\/ref\\/6\\/?campaign=WLI\\\">See what Tim Strifler over at Divi LIfe has done with this phenomenal Plugin<\\/a><\\/p>\\n<p>The uber talented <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/elegantmarketplace.com\\/vendor\\/melissa-love\\/\\\">Melissa Love<\\/a>\\u00a0of The Design Space uses it on one of her beautiful client sites and in some of her ecommerce related child themes - <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.cococuscino.com\\/product\\/coco-hurricane\\/\\\">take a look\\u00a0<\\/a><\\/p>\\n<p>A <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/elegantmarketplace.com\\/vendor\\/michellen\\/\\\">Michelle Nunan of Divi Soup<\\/a> uses the Woo Layout injector in her ecommerce child themes too - it really is a fantastically appreciated Divi Plugin<\\/p>\\n<p>To really put the icing on the cake you have a beautiful header mini cart and a whole raft of custom made modules to allow you to design your pages as you see fit!<\\/p>\\n<p>In short, this plugin adds a number of bespoke and highly configurable custom modules to the Divi Builder and a settings page to link them together. You have the freedom of the Divi Page Builder which we all know and love to construct a variety of layouts to suit your needs!<\\/p>\\n<p>Using Woo Layout Injector you can create a <span style=\\\"text-decoration: underline;\\\">very flexible<\\/span> and configurable layout for your WooCommerce archives and product category pages. To make this as flexible as possible we create TWO layouts. One\\u00a0that will be used for the archive page itself and another\\u00a0which is repeatedly used for each <em>item (product)<\\/em>\\u00a0in 'the loop'.<\\/p>\\n<p>Let's say we have an archive page showing 9 items in 3 rows of 3 items. We first create a 'loop item' template in the Divi library (Divi Library &gt; Add new &gt; Layout (non global)). This will feature normally an image, title, price, read more button etc..\\u00a0Once that is saved you can create the second layout which will be the archive. This\\u00a0may feature a nice header, the 'loop archive' module\\u00a0and then a footer or anything else to suit your design! Within the loop archive module you can select list or grid view. I find that list view works well especially when your 'loop item' layout has multiple columns of it's own or a grid of products such as that used on elegantmarketplace.com.<\\/p>\\n<p>For a Deeper Dive and full instructions on how to use this plugin once installed - <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/elegantmarketplace.com\\/the-ultimate-manual-on-the-woo-layout-injector\\/\\\">have a look at this great article where you can download a full instructional PDF.\\u00a0<\\/a><br \\/>\\nThat's it!<br \\/>\\nEach time you want to make a change to the layout just visit the Divi Library page and edit your layout as before. No need to relink or anything else. This really is a set and forget plugin that will yield a unique and bespoke looking WooCommerce store without you having to write any code at all :)<br \\/>\\nModules<br \\/>\\nThere are no fewer than custom 37 modules available to you using Woo Injector.

This plugin was released and flourished from mid 2016. It was, and still is, revolutionary in the features and functionality on offer with new updates coming all the time. Keep an eye on the changelog on this page or within the plugin itself for more exciting additions to the plugin. The new layout library will be a site showing a number of product page and product archive layouts created using Woo Layout Injector with the option to download the JSON files for use on your own store. Watch this space!<br \\/>\\nVideo<br \\/>\\nThis video is an hour long but it shows me setting up and explaining how the plugin works and how to integrate it into your site in a clear way. (was made for 4.0, we are now a few months down the line and some of the screens may have changed).<\\/p>\\n<p>https:\\/\\/youtu.be\\/zviia2GsCSc<br \\/>\\nNote<br \\/>\\nAdding the new modules to a non WooCommerce page are unlikely to work. The modules are designed for use on a WooCommerce product page only via the Divi library. Please contact us if you are unsure about this or have a problem setting things up.<\\/p>\\n<p>This plugin is designed to\\u00a0work with the vast majority of third party WooCommerce extensions. On occasion, third party plugins which also modify the product page may not be 100% compatible. <strong>Don't worry though!<\\/strong> Simply put in a support request with the vendor or Elegant Marketplace and we shall build in compatibility as soon as we are able.<\\/p>\\n<p><em>Please be aware though that we comprehensively test Woo Layout Injector with a variety of popular WooCommerce plugins to ensure compatibility across the range.<\\/em><\\/p>\\n<p>We have an Excellent guide to setup and troubleshooting on the Elegant Marketplace blog.
