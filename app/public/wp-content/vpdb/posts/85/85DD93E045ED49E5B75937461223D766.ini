post_content = "Today Hank begins to teach you about Philosophy by discussing the historical origins of philosophy in ancient Greece, and its three main divisions: metaphysics, epistemology, and value theory. He will also introduce logic, and how you're going to use it to understand and critically evaluate a whole host of different world views throughout this course. And also, hopefully, the rest of your life."
