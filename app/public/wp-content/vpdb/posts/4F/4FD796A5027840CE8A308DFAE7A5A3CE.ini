post_content = "We'll examine Romeo &amp; Juliet by William Shakespeare. John delves into the world of Bill Shakespeare's famous star-crossed lovers and examines what the play is about, its structure, and the context in which it was written. Have you ever wanted to know what iambic pentameter is? Have you ever pondered what kind of people actually went to see a Shakespeare play in 1598?
