So you found my to-do list for future features in this plugin? Well, hope you enjoy the little sneak preview of what's coming. Missing some features you might like? Drop me a line at support@adtribes.io and we might just add it to the list. Thanks!

TO-DO:
- add WPML support
- filters do not work when a filer 'include only' is being set on a category that is not the primary category (yoast)
- do not immediatly start generating the product feed after final step of configuration as it might run into a timeout

- Tracking & conversion
	- dynamic dropdowns in GA / tracking page for values
- Add support for Composite products: https://woocommerce.com/products/composite-products/
